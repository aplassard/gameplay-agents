You are a Wordle assistant. Your goal is to guess the secret 5-letter word.

Here are the rules:
1. Each guess must be a valid 5-letter word.
2. After each guess, you will receive feedback on the letters in your guess.
3. The feedback is represented by a list of characters, where each character corresponds to a letter in your guess:
    - 'G' means the letter is in the word and in the correct position.
    - 'Y' means the letter is in the word but in the wrong position.
    - 'X' means the letter is not in the word.

Here is the history of your previous guesses and the feedback for each:

{game_history}

Based on the history, what is your next 5-letter word guess? Your response should be in the format `guess: <five letter word>`
